# 🧠 One-Shot Inventory Updator (Computer Vision)

Automate your inventory management with the power of **Computer Vision**!  
This project enables **automatic stock detection and update** from a single image capture, drastically reducing manual effort and human error in warehouses and retail environments.
## 🚀 Project Overview

Managing large inventories manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.  
The **One-Shot Inventory Updator** leverages **deep learning and computer vision** to recognize, count, and update inventory levels using a **single image**.  

This system:
- Detects and identifies inventory items in a captured image.
- Estimates quantities in real time.
- Updates stock levels automatically in the backend system or database.
